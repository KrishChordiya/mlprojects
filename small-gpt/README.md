## Introduction
It is a gpt but not decoder based. It uses encoder also and therefore fails :).

## Why
I implemented "Attention is all you need" [[Implementation]](http://github.com/KrishChordiya/mlthings). Curious to know I trained squadV2 dataset on basic transformer. I think there is no need of demo for my work
